# GNSS_measurement_analysis
This is a project done as a part of an IoT course, which analyses data collected from
Googleâ€™s GNSSLogger Android App in various environments (indoor, outdoor, partial sky, etc)

Various parameters; like Distance Errors, Average SNR, No. of Satellites, Average Elevation, Average Azimuth,
are then checked against each other for any correlation.

More details on the process and observations can be found [here](./GNSS_Measurement_Analysis__ED18B027_Report.pdf)

Below is a short description of what each file does.
## parse.py

Parses logfiles in raw_logs and temporarily puts them in `./tmp`
These are then deleted by the main program. This is NOT to be run to
is used by the other 2 programs.

## distribution_per_fix.py

How to run: `python3 distribution_per_fix.py` in terminal

Terminal Output for each logfile:

	parsing <logfile>.txt
	Mean Latitude: 17.50333544537816
	Mean Longitude: 78.33146113058821
	Median # of Satellites: 5.0
  
Then:
1. Shows CDF & PDF of dist_errors
1. Shows Scatter-Plot: Corellation b/w dist_errors and satellites_used
1. Shows Scatter-Plot: Corellation b/w dist_errors and avg_SNR_per_fix

## distribution_per_satellite.py

How to run: `python3 distribution_per_satellite.py` in terminal

Terminal Output for each logfile:

```
parsing gnss_log_2_partial_sky.txt
svid  | avg_snr           | avg_azimuth      | avg_elevation
a     | xx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx | xx.xxxxxxxxxxxxx | xx.xxxxx
b     | xx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx | xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxx | xx.xxxxx
```

Then:
1. Shows Avg_Elevation vs Average_SNR Plot
2. Shows Avg_Azimuth vs Average_SNR Plot
